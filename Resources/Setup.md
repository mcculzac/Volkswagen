First thing you want to do is to log in. Default password is changeme.  
Then you need to create a GitHub account (I've preinvited using your student, 
but if you decide to use a different one just let me know and I'll invite you). 
Make one, then open GitHub desktop (
in applications), and log in.  Then open PyCharm, it'll ask for a Jetbrains account. 
Go to the webpage make a jet brains USING YOUR STUDENT.  You get access to the software for free with educational package. 
Then once you have that set up log into pycharm. Then there will be a window that 
says "Add Revision Control" or something like that. Click it and then click on Git.  
After that log into your GitHub account (requires email), and then if you hit the arrow on the right for the first dialogue 
box it should lists your repositories. Pick the Volkswagen one and then hit clone.
