Github Tutorials:
I’d recommend installing GitHub desktop from here: https://desktop.github.com/
There is a terminal based that I’d recommend learning but the desktop can do pretty much everything
the console based can that matters.

After making an account I’d recommend creating your own repo and following the tutorials 
and try and understand branches merging. You can think of it as a super advanced version control, or wikipedia edit history.

The main flow to coding/developing things is you create your own branch (I’ve already created one Called zm), you clone to your system, do your coding locally all that jazz, and then commit it to your branch.  
Then after you’re ready, you do a pull request to master, at which at least 1? (Maybe 2) 
people will review your code and then accept the merge to master.  
This allows people to work on different things at once, even if they are working on similar files. Obviously that should be minimized but it happens, and GitHub is pretty good at collision resolving.  
Also: if you do something you’re not sure about, feel free to make a new branch 
(like in my case I have zm, but I could make zm2, zm3 etc.) in order to experiment. 
If it works, merge it into your main branch, and if not, you can just delete it and you lose nothing.
You can also choose to merge individual files.  It is complicated, but it’s sort of like spending 10 hours learning now should help long term future. Note this will be periodically updated.
