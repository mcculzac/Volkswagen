# Volkswagen Cognitive Enterprise Software Robots

Welcome to the landing page for our project.

We are applying machine learning and NLP techniques to aid in automating the business process, decreasing labor time on repetitive manual tasks, increasing productivity and boosting operational speeds.

## Project Description
The design of the cognitive enterprise software robot focuses on analyzing data of file and sending and receiving emails. This robot is able to do manual tasks that a person is performing to parse data, do simple calculation, send an email to specific people, and make decision based on the email it gets back.
